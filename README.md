Solar What?! is the outcome of ongoing research at the University of Edinburgh.
The product design process has taken place over three continents, with input from solar technicians, end users and energy access practitioners.
In 2017 over 6 million small, solar powered lighting devices were sold worldwide and 1.6 million solar powered lighting devices entered electronic waste flows.
We believe that delivering affordable, clean energy for all can also promote responsible production and consumption.
Our goal is to advocate for sustainable design in the global solar industry and promote the repair, reuse and recycling of solar powered electronics. We are pro-solar, anti-waste.

The Solar What?! Power is one of two products we have designed to champion our research and catalyse discussion about what it means to be sustainable in the off-grid solar sector. The repository for other product, the Solar What Light, can be found [here](https://github.com/SolarWhat/Light-SW1001 "here")
